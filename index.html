			<h2>Tragic Carpet Visual Theatre presents</h2>
			<h1>RENDITION</h1>
			<h3><a href="http://hiddendoorblog.org/">at the Hidden Door Festival 2017</a></h3>
			<p>
				<i>“Extraordinary rendition is the transfer—without legal process—of a detainee to the custody of a foreign government for purposes of detention and interrogation”</i>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Between 2001 and 2009 over 130 individuals have been held and tortured as part of the CIA’s detention and interrogation programme.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>RENDITION</b> uses puppetry, soundscapes, object, shadow and visual theatre to explore the collusion between the CIA and the British Government; the juxtaposition between extreme vulnerability and absolute power; and the story of one man’s experience as the first suspect to be taken into the CIA detention programme.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>RENDITION</b> is a eulogy to human fortitude and was first devised and performed at Curious Puppetry School’s final showing in March 2016 as a response to the creative brief: ‘Shifting Focus, being two characters simultaneously’.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>TRAGIC CARPET VISUAL THEATRE</b> formed in 1988 out of Middlesex Polytechnic. Tragic Carpet exists to explore the stories of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. The company uses ensemble visual theatre, movement, object theatre, puppetry, circus, mime movement, music and light to tell its epic stories.
