			<h2>Tragic Carpet Visual Theatre presents</h2>
			<h1>RENDITION</h1>
			<p>
				Between 2001 and 2009 over 130 individuals have been held and tortured as part of the CIA’s detention and interrogation programme.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>RENDITION</b> uses puppetry, soundscapes, object, shadow and visual theatre to explore the collusion between the CIA and the British Government; the juxtaposition between extreme vulnerability and absolute power; and the story of one man’s experience as the first suspect to be taken into the CIA detention programme.
